its name from the apple ipod although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast . a podcast is basically an internet based radio show which podcasters create usually in the comfort of their own home . they need only a microphone a pc and some editing software . they then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them all for free . using technology based on xml computer code and rss really simple syndication listeners can subscribe to podcasts collected automatically in a bit of software which mr curry has pioneered . the latest mp files of shows can then be picked up by a music playing device automatically . mr curry records hosts edits and produce a daily minute podcast called the daily source code . he wants to make podcasting the next big thing and says it is an extension of his childhood love of radio gadgetry . i was always into technologies and wires he explains . my parents gave me the radio shack project kit which allows you to build an am transmitter and subsequently an fm transmitter . i had my mom drive me around the block see how far it would reach on the car radio . mr curry is american but he grew up in the netherlands where he hosted illegal pirate radio shows in the dutch capital . he tried university in the us and ended up back in holland where he hosted a music video show . he spent the next seven years in new york where he worked at mtv hosting the top video countdown but spent most of his hours tinkering with this new thing called the internet . at a certain point in i was driving in on a friday afternoon beautiful blue sky one of those beautiful days thinking this is so stupid . you know i m going do the top countdown take the cheque go home and sit on the internet until three in the morning . so after i finished the show i quit . i said on air it s been great i ve been here for seven years at that point there s something on the internet i ve got to go find it and i ll see you later . but mr curry s technology and broadcast interests started to gel a couple of years ago when computer storage was growing exponentially and high speed internet connections were becoming more widely available . the mp format also meant that people could create and upload audio more cheaply and efficiently than ever before . most importantly mr curry says people across the globe were bored with the radio they were hearing . listen to of the radio that you hear today it s radio voices and it s fake it s just fake . he wanted to make it easier for people to find real voices on the internet . he wanted software that would automatically download new audio content directly onto players like ipods . mr curry is not a computer programmer so he asked others to create one for him . no one did so he tried to write one himself . he finished it a few months ago and says it totally sucked . he put it up on the net as open source software and now dozens of coders and audio junkies are refining it the result is a work in progress called ipodder . doug kaye a california based podcaster praises the former mtv vj for what he has done . adam created a simple script that solved what we call the last mile problem . ipodder takes audio from the web and brings it all the way down to the mp player he explains . people can wake up in the morning pick up their ipods as they go to work or before they go exercise and discover that there s all this new content automatically put onto their players . it is created an explosion in podcasting content and podcasters are springing up in australia finland brazil even malaysia . one couple broadcasts theirs the dawn and drew show from wisconsin in the us sometimes even from the comfort of their own bed . topics range from the comfort of their bed to the latest films or music and have thousands of listeners . already websites are springing up that point listeners in the right direction of good podcasts . chris mcintyre runs podcast alley and says that there are good sites out there but that not everyone has the technological know how to simply listen . if i were to tell my mom or my mother in law to copy an xml or rss file to their podcast aggregator they would think i was speaking a foreign language mr mcintyre says . along with technical challenges there may be legal challenges to podcasters who air their favourite albeit copyrighted music . some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see as the anti radio into something that is more like conventional broadcasting . already there is interest in podcasting from the corporate world . heineken is doing its own podcast now and so is playboy . for his part adam curry s pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be . he loves doing the daily source code because it is about introducing good music and cool ideas to new audiences . he has even been called the ed sullivan or johnny carson of podcasting which he says is a badge i ll wear with great honour . to be the johnny carson or ed sullivan of anything is wonderful . and you know what ? you don t need a hell of a lot of talent . you just have to be nice have your ears open and let people shine . and that s good for me . clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh boston co production .']\n",

thoughts about going for the double in athens . i thought why wouldn t you do the m it s your best event ? it was such good fun to commentate on her m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story . the victory for the british men s x m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games . i think the four of them jason gardener darren campbell marlon devonish and mark lewis francis knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal . the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake . hicham el guerrouj s olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kelly s on a global scale . he was the first man since for years to win both the m and m titles . as soon as he had added the m crown and i had finished commentating i jumped up ran down the stairs pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug . he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories . hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with even though my french and his english are not very good . what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well . there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood . dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the m five days later was not wise . that was her heart and not her head reacting . paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day . things like niggling injuries not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her . i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained . and if even the smallest thing doesn t feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall . the positive thing to take from paula s olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people including me . purely as a race paula s victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling . it was so nip and tuck between her and kenya s susan chepkemei and you don t usually get that kind of excitement in marathons . it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because to use one of my favourite words paula showed real bouncebackability . and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out . kelly and the x m boys victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team . we should be concerned that we re not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level . the only individual men s finalist on the track was michael east in the m . i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed ? and that s where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy . dani barnes came fourth in the m and she was the highest finisher for team gb . the thing is if we don t have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn t look good for the beijing olympics and beyond . i tell you what i really enjoyed this year benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march . in the absence of paula we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve . so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special . to be honest i m getting bored with all the drug scandals especially balco . i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on . having said that i m always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore . and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle . we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats . as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while . the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it .']\n",

      "['paris promise raises welsh hopes', 'has there been a better six nations match than saturday s epic in paris ? and can the welsh revival continue all the way to a first grand slam since ? those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in paris . welsh legend mervyn davies a member of two of three grand slam winning sides of the s hailed it as one of the great performances of the past three decades . martyn williams wales two try scorer on the day called it one of the most surreal games i have ever played in . a crestfallen france coach bernard laporte simply observed there was a french half and there was a welsh half . and what a half it was for the red dragonhood transforming a half time deficit into an lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period . but while that passage of play showed the swelling self belief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this welsh side . that they recovered from a battering in the first half hour to first stem the tide before half time then reverse it on the resumption was remarkable enough . but in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of french pressure in a nail biting final five minutes wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve . in international rugby any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis . england suffered some infamous six nations disappointments en route to world cup glory the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered . wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light . but the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline . ten of the on duty on saturday were also involved when wales were trounced in paris two years ago . but since they threw off the shackles against new zealand in the world cup wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place . the confidence in the squad has been building and building since the world cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class noted coach mike ruddock . the likes of michael owen gethin jenkins dwayne peel and gavin henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer s lions tour to new zealand . and players like stephen jones martyn williams shane williams and gareth thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve . jones after his superb man of the match display observed that we are a very happy camp now . ruddock and thomas can take much of the credit for that ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad . the joie de vivre so evident in that magical second half spell in paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the s . if england had half the innate attacking exuberance wales have produced in this championship they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats . similarly wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches and that forward power mental toughness and good decision making under pressure are equally important . so on to murrayfield where wales have not won on their last three visits . while the hype in the principality will go into overdrive the players will set about the task of beating scotland . only then with the visit of ireland to finish can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the s and writing their own names into welsh legend .']\n",

oh and of course you can always use the phone to make voice calls and send texts something which ensures that it is always in someone s pocket or handbag available for other uses too . i have never really approved of using the internet protocol ip to do either audio or video streaming and i think that technically it is a disaster to make phone calls over the net using voice over ip . but i have to acknowledge that the net at least here in the developed western countries is fast and reliable enough to do both . i stream radio to my computer while i work and enjoy hearing the bizarre stations from around the world that i can find online but nowhere else . i am even playing with internet telephony despite my reservations and i appear on go digital on the world service streamed over the web each week . but g networks have been designed to do this sort of streaming both for voice and video which gives them an edge over net based ip services . the g services aren t quite there yet and there is a lot to be sorted out when it comes to web access and data charges . vodafone will let you access its services on vodafone live ! as part of your subscription cost but it makes you pay by the megabyte to download from other sites this one for example . this will not matter to business users but will distort the consumer market and keep people within the phone company s collection of partner sites something that should perhaps be worrying telecoms regulator ofcom . but we should not see these new phones simply as cut down network terminals . if i want fast access to my e mail i can get a g card for my laptop or hook up to a wireless network . the phone is a lot more and it is as a combination of mini tv personal communications device and music video player that it really works . there is certainly room in the technology ecosystem for many different sorts of devices accessing a wide range of services over different networks . g phones and ipods can co exist at least for a while but if i had to bet on the long term i would go for content on demand over carrying gigabytes in my pocket . or perhaps some enterprising manufacturer will offer me both . an mp g player anyone ?

      "['booming markets shed few tears', 'the market former british government minister michael heseltine once said has no morality . and indeed stock exchange traders around asia have wasted little time regretting the victims of this week s disaster . stock markets in indonesia and india have hit all time highs this week even in sri lanka more comprehensively affected the main index has lost only since the waves hit . bigger markets further afield have barely twitched . the msci world share index a measure of global stock market performance hit its highest level this week since early the bbc global has risen by in the past week . and this at a time when all sentiment aside insurance costs are already estimated in the tens of billions of dollars and countries around the region are looking at trimming their growth forecasts . in fact the markets are being perfectly rational . for a start the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines . the overwhelming majority of the victims will have had no insurance according to estimates from india only one quarter of those affected there were wealthy enough to afford insurance and only one quarter of that group at most will have taken out policies . indonesia is likely to have even lower take up rates . and where insurance certainly is in place in for example the many tourist complexes affected the costs will be borne in far away corners of the global reinsurance market rather than landing locally . second stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged . most of the biggest companies traded on the soaring jakarta stock exchange are in oil technology and financial services none of which have been hit by the flooding . tourist businesses the most likely sufferers are either foreign owned or too small to have their shares listed . those that are listed have suffered confifi hotel holdings a small sri lankan tourism firm has halved in value this week . but there are winners as well as losers . asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities . in indonesia shares in state construction companies adhi karya and semen gresik have jumped sharply this week . more broadly the academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their longer term economic impact . according to the natural hazards research and applications information center at colorado state university there is little evidence that disasters are inevitably followed by a depression . the need to find money to replace lost and damaged property is balanced by the beneficial effect of reconstruction activity there is rarely the centre says any sort of rebuilding boom but in most cases sizeable indirect losses are avoided . a study of the des moines floods from the disaster research center at the university of delaware found that of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster and another felt themselves better off . although it is commonly assumed on the basis of anecdotal evidence that disasters result in business failures and bankruptcies on a large scale our research indicates that most businesses even those that are especially hard hit do indeed recover the authors concluded . but disasters have a vast psychological impact and markets are driven by psychological factors . in particular many analysts warn of panic spreading unchecked through the global financial system as investors seek to cover themselves against the unforeseeable effects of unguessable events . in fact again the risks here are lower than they seem . even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market currently trillion and rising . a series of recent shocks the colorado centre has argued have demonstrated that this seamless global contagion hardly ever happens market tremors rarely translate into economic slumps and economic woes rarely seriously undermine markets . the trillion dollar debts of japan s banks for example have had no effect on stock markets further afield than tokyo . and the us stock market was on its way down long before september it rose by during the six months following the attacks . it is not that the broking community is indifferent to disasters or feelings one bombay trader said this week . but the reaction would have been seen if business had been affected . business sense probably tends to overrule everything else .

it s all well and good robert kilroy silk claiming that veritas is a party that doesn t believe in lies and spin but the truth of the matter is its completely useless due to proportional representation there is no chance that veritas will have any chance in claiming power and change the two horse race trend . in my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which has just been used as a smoke screen for his anti islamism slurs which got him sacked from the television . i think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many . it really is time that the uk government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue . in addition as an ashfield constituent i would be more than interested in kilroy silk opposing geoff hoon ! ! good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done . let s hope kilroy silk ukip and the euro sceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe . we benefit enormously from our membership of the eu we need to be at the heart of europe leading it and driving it to where we as a country want to go not running away from it . all mouth and trousers . a clown . trouble is any votes he collects may just end up helping new labour into a third term . whatever kilroy silk and ukip do none of their anti european policies have any relevance outside middle england . this new party might gain support from right wing england but will have little impact in wales or scotland . hopefully this all this fighting within euro sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue . england needs europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better we can t rely on the usa forever ! at last an impetus for increasing the likely turn out for the election . the electorate is disillusioned with british politics . kilroy has one agenda the uk and i ll be voting for him . both ukip and rk s are representatives of small mindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind . the interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these people s bickering that who in the overall scheme of things really cares about their petty tiff ? many people believe you kilroy . you may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility . the very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as euroscepticism or british supremacy is nauseating . one can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls . i ve always thought that kilroy silk was a self publicising egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion . brilliant about time this country had a plausible party ! having seen the recent bbc documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior ukip figures i can well understand why kilroy silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people . hopefully the ukip members who are interested in the political debate will support his action . fantastic news . pro europeans now have far less to worry about from the right . the conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid s and the extreme anti europeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local european and general elections . robert kilroy silk s ego and vanity are his own and his supporters worst enemy . as a euro enthusiast i could not be more delighted by kilroy silk s behaviour . he took a party that was just building up a head of steam and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coup d etat he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two . the closer to straight down the middle the better as far as i am concerned but in any eventuality the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other . if every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose we d have ballot papers a mile long ! you ve got to hand it to kilroy silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self belief . whilst not being a great fan of kilroy i do agree with his comments about the ukip leadership and like him i am also leaving ukip . i believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the eu and to show our people what belonging to the eu really means . the eu s comments last week about michael howard s plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the eu and not individual member states . the sooner we leave this corrupt super state the better does anyone else think that it is ironic that euro sceptic kilroy silk has used a latin name for his new party rather than a good old british name ? is this indicative of the man contradictory vain and pompous ? i think mr kilroy silk has got a very good point . british politics has become too pc and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians . they are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power . as a result i feel our democracy is being abused and i want it stopped . if mr kilroy silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote . honestly who really cares ? man with tan leaves party with no plan to set up party with no idea . as one of kilroy silk s east midlands constituents i hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity . i feel insulted by having him represent me in the european parliament . ukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him . someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of ukip s democratic nature . kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician in exactly the way those who lead ukip are not . he tried to make it work but they didn t seem to want to grow up . he was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media . this new party seems a logical next step for kilroy . good luck to the man i say . oh please ! this is an amusing irrelevance . there is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating a sensible and constructive eurosceptic argument . they will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed more democratic more dynamic europe union . future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness . the refreshing thing about robert is that he is open honest and straight . what other politician can claim this . i have a suspicion that he talks for a larger part of the electorate that his critics would like . i shall be voting for him . the electorate of the east midlands voted not for kilroy silk but for the ukip . kilroy silk was made an mep because of his position on the ukip s party list . he has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the european parliament . i wouldn t write off kilroy silk . while he s a clown and a one man band at the moment he s a populist and that s always dangerous .the man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters that seems to be one of the factors in success . good luck to kilroy though i think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle . the man i once found cringe worthy on day time tv could well turn out to be my country s knight in shining armour . he expresses views which are now more than common amongst society today but people are almost too scared to express them . kilroy silk has secured my vote and many more like me . what s more i look forward to the day when he claims victory wrecks the eu and rescues my great nation . . . without a hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever ! great stuff . the longer the uk dithers over europe the richer we in ireland become as the only english speaking country fully committed to europe . oh and send us over those hard working immigrants our economy needs them . this is just what the europhiles pray for . as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe . having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further . thank goodness that kilroy silk has gone now ukip at least has a chance in the election ! it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip . robert kilroy silk could have a lot to offer . instead we have a split party and a damaged cause . under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation . last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroy silk . it is a great shame this has been dissipated in in fighting . ukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu . this kilroy silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party . neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes . veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy silk . if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another . so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow ! interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name ! every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti europe feeling in this country . kilroy silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue . he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience . we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes . it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians . kilroy silk may just have those very qualities . recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come ! well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party . it s all flash and no real policy here let s hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy silk slipping into obscurity . veritas ? the name will doom it . but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not ? the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the too twee label of veritas symbolises that ?']\n",

      "['what high definition will do to dvds', 'first it was the humble home video then it was the dvd and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment high definition . high definition gives incredible d like pictures and surround sound . the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out . but when high definition films do come out on the new format dvds it will profoundly change home entertainment . for rick dean director of business development for digital content company thx a high definition future is an exciting prospect . he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy finding nemo the incredibles and indiana jones . there was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds he told the bbc news website . the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined . the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master he says . but currently putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high definition films demand . as much as you compress the picture data rate wise you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master he explains . i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high def world and i find it very exciting . high definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to . it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high definition dvds in months time . mr dean is confident though i think if they see real hd high definition not some heavily compressed version of it there is such a remarkable difference . i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen . high definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too . on the whole producing films for high definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed . equally it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd . when we master movies right now our data rates are running at about . gigabits per second says mr dean . our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second . that s a huge amount of compression that has to be applied about . so if you have anything that allows more space you don t have to compress so hard . studios could fit a lot more marketing material games and features onto high capacity dvds . currently an entire dvd project can take up to three months says mr dean . although the step of down converting will be bypassed this will realistically only save a day s work says mr dean . one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems . on the fairly complex star wars disks making sure the menu buttons worked took human hours alone . if studios want to cash in on the extra space it could mean extra human hours for which someone has to pay . if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required . and if studios do focus on delivering more added value content thinks mr dean ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it . those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high definition dvd . but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price studios will listen thinks mr dean . high definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike . more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous . when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i everybody was very sun tanned but that was make up . in the hd version of episode i all these make up lines showed up explains mr dean . the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too . there are scans of a corridor on the death star and fairly plainly in one of those shots there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways . you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn t see it . what high definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur . with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas this line blurs even further . it could also mean that how we get films and in what format will widen . in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip internet protocol broadband giving a dvd like experience from the set top box to the hard drive says mr dean . but that is some time off for most and for now people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves .']\n",

it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip . robert kilroy silk could have a lot to offer . instead we have a split party and a damaged cause . under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation . last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroy silk . it is a great shame this has been dissipated in in fighting . ukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu . this kilroy silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party . neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes . veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy silk . if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another . so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow ! interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name ! every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti europe feeling in this country . kilroy silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue . he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience . we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes . it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians . kilroy silk may just have those very qualities . recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come ! well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party . it s all flash and no real policy here let s hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy silk slipping into obscurity . veritas ? the name will doom it . but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not ? the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the too twee label of veritas symbolises that ?']\n",
